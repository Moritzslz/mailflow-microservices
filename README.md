# mailflow-microservices

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-puccess-green)](#)  

> A microservices suite for the Mailflow platform â€” decomposed services that manage components of the email workflow system.

## About

**mailflow-microservices** is the microservices architecture underpinning the Mailflow platform. Each functionality (e.g. sending email, routing logic, tracking, AI-completion) is separated into independent services, enabling scalability, independent deployment, and clearer boundaries.

This project is part of the broader Mailflow ecosystem (with **mailflow-api**, **mailflow-common**, **mailflow-ui**, etc.).

## Architecture & Services

A (non-exhaustive) breakdown of services:

| Service Name        | Responsibility / Domain                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `mail-service`     | Accepts requests to send emails, interacts with SMTP / mail engine of each registered email account of each tenant |
| `llm-service`   | Uses RAG service to create responses to emails    |
| `rag-service`  | Is used to crawl, embed and store websites and other documents   |

You may have more or fewer services depending on your implementation.
