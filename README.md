# mailflow-microservices

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-puccess-green)](#)  

> A microservices suite for the Mailflow platform â€” decomposed services that manage components of the email workflow system.

## About

**mailflow-microservices** is the microservices architecture underpinning the Mailflow platform. Each functionality (e.g. sending email, routing logic, tracking, AI-completion) is separated into independent services, enabling scalability, independent deployment, and clearer boundaries.

This project is part of the broader Mailflow ecosystem (with **mailflow-api**, **mailflow-common**, **mailflow-ui**, etc.).

## Architecture & Services

A (non-exhaustive) breakdown of services:

| Service Name        | Responsibility / Domain                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `mailbox-service`     | Accepts requests to send emails, interacts with SMTP / mail engine of each registered email account of each tenant |
| `llm-service`   | Uses RAG service to create responses to emails    |
| `rag-service`  | Is used to crawl, embed and store websites and other documents   |

You may have more or fewer services depending on your implementation.

## Getting Started

### [Postman Collection](https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=21f8ac5d0e967131c6a9cf795897ff54811c386a6cb1bb24eadb221781835d14&target_code=9c0bb9ad3f6234d3f1710c5ade0084ed)

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (or the version your services use)  
- Gradle
- Docker / Docker Compose  
- Databases (PostgreSQL)

### Mailbox-Service && LLM-Service

#### application.yaml
Change to your mail server:
- `mail.host`
- `mail.port`
- `mail.username`

This is used for sending monitoring alerts to the email you specified as a username

### Env variables
- ACTIVE_PROFILE=dev;
- AES_B64_SECRET_KEY=someKey;
-   Needs to be the same as you used for the API
- CLIENT_NAME=mailbox-service;
- CLIENT_SECRET=secret;
-   Needs to be the same plain text as the encrpted value in the DB
- HMAC_B64_SECRET_KEY=someKey;
-   Same HMAC key as used for API
- MAIL_PASSWORD=password;
-   Password to your mail account
- RSA_PUBLIC_KEY=-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- someKey -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
-   This needs to be the same public key as you used for the API
 
### RAG-Service

#### application.yaml
Change to your mail server:
- `mail.host`
- `mail.port`
- `mail.username`

This is used for sending monitoring alerts to the email you specified as a username

### Env variables
- ACTIVE_PROFILE=dev;
- AES_B64_SECRET_KEY=someKey;
-   Needs to be the same as you used for the API
- CLIENT_NAME=mailbox-service;
- CLIENT_SECRET=secret;
-   Needs to be the same plain text as the encrpted value in the DB
- HMAC_B64_SECRET_KEY=someKey;
-   Same HMAC key as used for API
- MAIL_PASSWORD=password;
-   Password to your mail account
- RSA_PUBLIC_KEY=-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- someKey -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
-   This needs to be the same public key as you used for the API
-   DB_PASSWORD=root;
-   DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/rag_db;
-   DB_USERNAME=admin
